  Was in the car all day, didn't have time to work.

* March 10, 2019
Just Finished implementing the O(N^2) version of SAH k-d tree construction in python
Beginning to do the O(N log^2 N) implementation.
Came into some bugs and wasn't able to fully finish implementation.
Had a short work day because of a family outing.

* March 11, 2019
I have undivided work time today.
Spent a couple hours debugging.
Finally figured it out, stupid mistake. I have the O(N^2) implementation done.
Implemented the O(N log^2 N) algorithm.
I am feeling very tired and i'm not going to be able to do the O(N log N) today. I may try later ****UPDATE****
Unfortunatley I have another 5 hour car ride back to Toronto tomorrow. Hopefully i'll be able to get some work done during the ride, but im not sure.
